# Belly Button Biodiversity
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visualize dummy bacteria data using Plotly, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and HTML on a webpage. The data is stored in a JSON file and comprises human test subjects' demographic information, belly button microbacterial cultures identified, and belly button washing frequency. An event listener - a drop-down selection box - is used to switch test subjects and view their individual data points. 

To view this data - a Python server must be run.

## Results
Using Plotly, three main graphs are showcased:

 - A bar chart showing the Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found
 

 - A gauge chart showing the belly button frequency of the test subject


 - A bubble chart with hover text 


 A panel with demographic info is also shown
