# Belly Button Biodiversity
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visualize dummy bacteria data using Plotly, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and HTML on a webpage. The data is stored in a JSON file and comprises human test subjects' demographic information, belly button microbacterial cultures identified, and belly button washing frequency. An event listener - a drop-down selection box - is used to switch test subjects and view their individual data points. 

To view this data a Python server must be run.

## Results
The complete webpage using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap is:

Using Plotly, three main graphs are showcased:

 - A bar chart showing the Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found
